# What is it

The Takadimi system is an aid to getting used to rhythms. Anyone dabbling in
odd time signatures, non-western music, or strange note groupings
would probably find it beneficial to get to grips with it.

So... Let's begin!

# Takadimi

The way it works is pretty simple. There is a syllable per note.
For instance:

4 notes grouped together would be

**ta**-ka-**di**-mi.

3 notes grouped would be

**ta**-ki-da

Note that there are two stressed syllables above.
Before we dive in, let's explain the rules a bit.

## Rules

**ta** should _always_ be the first syllable. **ta** falls on the beat.
The **di** syllable should fall on the middle of the beat.


> How can I use **di** on a beat that doesn't have a middle? i.e. 7/8.

Well, odd groupings and time signatures are a bit harder to work with for precisely this reason.

For example, a  4/4 grouping will 90% of the time be grouped in 2 groups of 2.

|    |    |    |
ta   ka   di   mi

Now this is simple. We just divide the beat in half and we have our middle.
In the case of an odd time signature, I'd suggest splitting it in the most convenient way for you.

If we're in 7/8, the 2 most common divisions of notes I could think of would be

A 3 and a 4

|    |    |    |    |    |    |

A 4 and a 3

|    |    |    |    |    |    |

## Examples

# Reference

Here's a list of one kind of the groupings you can do

1
Ta

2
Ta di

3
Ta ki da

4
Ta ka di mi

5
Ta ka di mi ti

6
Ta va ki di da ma

7
Ta va ki di da ma ti

8

> You've only explained straight rhythms, what about rests or notes holding for longer than other notes?

# Conclusion

The amount of combinations that you can split a bunch of notes is pretty gigantic.
I've outlined some common ones above but as always you should fiddle around.

Here are some exercises for a 7/8 grouping.

Create a (TODO) for 1 and 6
Create a (TODO) for 2 and 5
Create a (TODO) for 3 and 4
Create a (TODO) for 4 and 3
Create a (TODO) for 5 and 2
Create a (TODO) for 6 and 1

Listen to the differences!
