# What is it?

Basically a templating view file for vim

i.e. the following

```
Hello, the time is {{strftime('sometimestamp')}}.
```

Should render immediately (when you open it) to

```
Hello, the time is 2018-05-14 10:12:00.
```

# Why?

Because I want to dynamically populate some pages that are time sensitive and I like vim.

# Problems

- Does it already exist? Is this what skeleton files are?
