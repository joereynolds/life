# Dev Build

(Think of a better name).

Something similar to vim-projectionist but:

- Not vim specific
- More featureful
- Written in Typescript (BECAUSE I LOVE IT)

## Features

- Navigate alternate files
- Run tests 
- Fire off arbitrary commands
- Vim plugin
- Templates for files (variables should be able to interpolated)

## Rambles      

- Config should be able to be stored as a file so you can version it and use it
  anywhere

## Questions

- What language (if any) are tasks written in? Or are they a configuration file?
