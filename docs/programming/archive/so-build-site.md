#So you want to a build a website?

Cool. Shouldn't be too hard right? And it's only for something simple, maybe a table of all the books I've read and links through to the book with a review by me. Sounds easy!

Let's see...

First I'll need to learn HTML just to get something showing up on the page and give me *some* motivation.

Hmmm, it looks kinda crappy, I know! CSS. Right now that I've got that sorted where should I go next?

Well, all my data is static and hardcoded at the moment so maybe I should look into a programming language. PHP will do nicely! Ahh... that also means I'll need learn about databases too. Mysql will go with that I guess...

Great! I'm almost there!

Except... Inputting any other data is kind of hacky when I have to put it directly in the HTML file. Maybe I should use a CMS? Everyone uses wordpress, I'll go with that!

Okay we're getting somewhere, I can edit data and have some dynamic data. The site still looks a little dull though and I'd like to do some things not possible with CSS...Javascript!

Hmmm Javascript is hard...jQuery!

Okay cool, I've got it all set up and working except for some reason I can't go to the site directly I have to go through some convoluted URL. I've read that something called 'Apache' is involved.

Okay yep it was Apache. I've changed the document root and am ready to go!'

Hit another snag... I was getting '403 Forbidden' errors on some pages. Guess i'll be spending the weekend learning about linux...

Alright so now I must be done right? Although, pure php is kind of hard to maintain and I need something built off a solid foundation. I'll use a framework...Hmmm Code Igniter? Zend? Laravel? Symfony?
I'll just pick one...Laravel!

Okay so I've never heard of this 'MVC' before but I think I've got it all setup now.

There are still a few gripes I have though. I heard that its good to 'minify'CSS and JS. I don't know what this means or how to do it.

Okay so I spent the weekend learning about grunt and NPM and now I can automatically minify my assets...What was I doing again? Oh yeah Books reviews!
