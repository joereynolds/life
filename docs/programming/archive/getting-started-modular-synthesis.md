# Modular Synthesis

List of things you'll need and recommendations.

## Rack

Go for a eurorack format, it seems like the most common and is fairly cheap.

Two good possible options for a rack/case are

- [TipTop Audio's happy ending kit](http://www.tiptopaudio.com/hek.php)
- [Doepfer A-100](http://www.proaudioeurope.com/keyboards/modular-synths/doepfer-a-100lc3-raw-wooden-case.html)

They both have the same capabilities (powered and 84hp)

## Modules

Modular synths are based on components/modules

### Essentials

These are the things you need at the very least just to make a sound

- An Oscillator like [this one](http://www.dv247.com/keyboards-and-midi/doepfer-a-143-3-eurorack-quad-lfo-module--219741)
- A VCA like [this one](http://www.dv247.com/keyboards-and-midi/doepfer-a-132-1-eurorack-synthesizer-module--106919)

### Everything else

- A Filter like [this one](http://www.dv247.com/keyboards-and-midi/doepfer-a-106-5-sem-filter-module--219733)
