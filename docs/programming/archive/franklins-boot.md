                                                                                 Highest - 6, lowest - 4, sum = 10
                                                                                 Classes
                                                                                 The attributes rolled determine what class you can be. If you have none of the required attributes for a class, you are a peasant and will later get an opportunity to choose a class after gaining more experience (If you do not have the attributes for a class you want to be, you can be a peasant in the mean time until you gain more experience).

Combat
INITIATIVE
In combat, the attacker goes first.
If the attacker is undecided or there was no initial attacker, the party with the highest roll on a D6 goes first (One roll per party).

TO HIT
If your strength + 2D6 is greater than the enemies defence + 2D6 : You hit

DAMAGE ROLL
Roll for damage (damage is dependent on the weapon wielded).
Experience, Levelling and Achievements

After battles you gain experience, the experience gained depends on the monster killed and any other factors that your DM wants to factor in.

For every 100XP, you gain a skill point. Skill points can be spent on improving your attributes.


To increase an attribute you must spend the attributes amount of skill points on it +1 (confusing sentence or what...)

Examples:

I have a strength of 9 and I must spend 10 skills points (str+1) in order to get my strength to 10.

I have an intelligence of 2 and I must spend 3 skill points (int+1) in order to get my intelligence to 3.

Simple!


Skill points may also be spent on spells. See the spells section for more information.

Spells
There are 5 levels of magic. Level 1 being the most basic and usually the least damaging, level 5 being complete catastrophe.
Mages may learn priest spells up to and including level 2. Priests may learn mage spells up to and including level 2. Peasants may not learn any magic.

Skill points can also be used on spells to indivdually improve a spell.
A spell has several attributes, its name, level, the amount of damage, any effects (if any) and it's caster level. The caster level begins at 0 for all spells and can only be improved by pumping skill points into it. As you put more points into the caster level of the spell, the spell gets more powerful and does more damage.

In order to improve the spell you must apply the same rules as improving your attributes
i.e.

Your spell short stab is currently at Caster level 3 so is inflicting an extra 3hp's worth of damage each cast. In order to improve it to level 4, you must spend 4 skill points on the caster level for that spell.
