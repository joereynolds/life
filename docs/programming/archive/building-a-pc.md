# Buying the parts

## Tools

### Minimum

- Philips head screwdriver
- Smaller Philips head screwdriver

### Nice to have

- Thermal paste
- Magnetic screwdriver
- A few different kinds of screwdriver

## Components

- RAM
- Hardrive
- Motherboard
- Power Supply
- Computer Case
- CPU (processor)
- GPU (graphics Card)
- Cooler (Optional if not overclocking)

### Optional

- Mouse
- Monitor
- Keyboard
- Optical drive/Disk drive

## Things to be weary of

- Try and use the same model/brand for RAM.

- Make sure that the cooler can fit in the case.
  For instance, if the cooler is 160mm high and the case
  can only accomodate 120mm high cooler, consider a different
  case/cooler. It's not entirely necessary to buy a cooler,
  there is a stock one with the processor most of the time.

- A good power supply is a good purchase. Cheap supplies
  will give 'dirty' power and cause components to damage
  over time.

- Make sure that the socket type of the CPU matches that of the
  motherboard.

- Make sure you have enough drive bays for the number of drives
  that you want to install. There will always be enough for one
  HD and an SSD. However, if you want 5+ drives, check the specs
  of the case.

- Make sure that your motherboard has the same memory slot as your
  RAM. For example, if your RAM is DDR3, then your motherboard will
  need to have DDR3 compatible slots otherwise they won't slot in

# Setup

## Preparation

- Install in a room without carpet & Olive (my cat).

- Make sure you have all tools and components in the room.

- Separate out all screws into some logical order for yourself.

## Installation

- Test all components before installing them in the case.
  (this is known as an 'out of the box build')
    - Just create the smallest possible test case to run the setup of the PC.

- Don't bother closing the panels until the computer actually works.

# Post-setup

- Make sure the CPU doesn't exceed 85 degrees otherwise it'll start
  throttling (slowing down to cool itself down).

- Make sure the GPU doesn't exceed 95 degrees (same reason as CPU).

- If you have an SSD, consider installing the OS on it (or other
  frequently used programs) for speeds sake. Use your main HD
  for any remaining media.

- Use Ninite for bulk install of the basic stuff (Chrome, Dropbox etc...)
