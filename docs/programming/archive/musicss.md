# MusiCSS

MusiCSS is a front-end scaffolding for displaying musical notation.
For example

## HTML

<div class="stave">
    <div class="notes">
        <div class="note c oct-4"></div>
    </div>
</div>

- Stave contains the entire thing
- Notes is a collection of 'note'. Useful for displaying hovers
  on multiple notes at one time
- note is the note itself
- C is the note for that '.note'
- oct-4 says that it's c in the 4th octave
