- Entr - a generic task runner. Compile CSS on change? Yep. Run SQL queries on
  change? yep. Shutdown your pc when a specific file has been modified in the
  last week? Sure why not?

- chronic - Only outputs a command if it failed (exited with a non-zero status).
  This is ridiculously useful for build scripts and saves all those horrible
  redirect hacks to /dev/null etc...

- fd - A super fast alternative to `find`.

- simplescreenrecorder - There are tons of screen recorders for linux out there
  but this one manages to work with Jack and i3 with no configuration.

- ts - Timestamps things

- vidir - Batch rename files in the spirit of Vim!
