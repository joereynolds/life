# 2 - The Rymer's (2 weeks later)

Mary: "NOOOOOO!! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER!!!"

Chris: "Mary my sweet, please. Bring yourself back down and try to relax"

Mary: "It's this house! We need to get out of this place!"

Chris: "And we will, in good time but until the decisions are finalised by the
court I think it's a good idea to stay put. We don't want to add a house-move to
the list of ever-growing stresses on this family."

Mary: "Oh Chris, please can we move? Move to somewhere far away where good
things happen to good people? My mind can't keep defending itself against the
memories of this house."

Chris: "Once *this* is a distant memory we can go wherever we want and do
whatever we want. It's only 3 more weeks until the final hearing and after that
we'll put this place up, pack our bags and drive. Drive as far as we can for as
long as we can, maybe even as fast as we can. Somewhere far away where good
things happen to good people."

Mary: "It's all I want Chris. This house is filled with too many painful
memories of him. I hope Billy is okay."

Chris: "He's surprised me Mary, out of all of us, he seems to be coping the
best. We've raised a beautiful son"

Mary thought to herself "and lost one too". 

Outwardly Mary smiled which seemed to fool not only Chris but also herself for a
short while. The idea of moving elsewhere was Mary's silver bullet - The thing
that would save her sanity, fix all of their problems and lead to a new start
with no turmoil.

Chris was Mary's rock and had been wearing that stone-skin for approximately 3 months
since "all of this" had happened. 
He was an emotionally strong man, a little over 6'3" with a reserved yet good
sense of dress and a steady gait that was unassuming.
