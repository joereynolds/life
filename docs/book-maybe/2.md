# 2 - The Rymer's (2 weeks later)

Mary: "NOOOOOO!! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER!!!"

Chris: "Mary my sweet, please. Bring yourself back down and try to relax"

Mary: "It's this house! We need to get out of this place!"

Chris: "And we will, in good time but until the decisions are finalised by the
court I think it's a good idea to stay put. We don't want to add a house-move to
the list of ever-growing stresses on this family."

Mary: "Oh Chris, please can we move? Move to somewhere far away where good
things happen to good people? My mind can't keep defending itself against the
memories of this house."

Chris: "Once *this* is a distant memory we can go wherever we want and do
whatever we want. We'll get that compensation from the school within a fortnight
and then we can live how we want. 3 more weeks until the final hearing
and then we'll put this place up, pack our bags and drive. Drive as far as
we can for as long as we can, maybe even as fast as we can. Somewhere far away
where good things happen to good people."

Mary: "It's all I want Chris. This house is filled with too many painful
memories of him. I hope Billy is okay."

Chris: "He's surprised me Mary, out of all of us, he seems to be coping the
best. We've raised a beautiful son"

Mary thought to herself "and lost one too". 

Outwardly Mary smiled which seemed to fool not only Chris but also herself for a
short while. The idea of moving elsewhere was Mary's silver bullet - The thing
that would save her sanity, fix all of their problems and lead to a new start
with no turmoil.

Chris was Mary's rock and had been wearing that stone-skin for approximately 3
months since the event had happened.  He was an emotionally strong man, a little
over 6'3" with a reserved yet good sense of dress and a steady gait that was
unassuming. 

By day Chris was a proofreader and fact-checker for (CITYNAME)'s academic
journal. Hundreds of prospective scientists and engineers would submit articles
to the journal and it was up to Chris to separate the good from the bad. If
Chris was happy with it, you'd probably see it in the next issue and that was
something Chris enjoyed. 

Mary had worked in the same line of work for many years too. In fact, this is how
the two met. Two unassuming people doing under valued work for a modest wage.
Mary had eventually decided to become self-employed doing similar work. She now
works as a freelance proofreader, usually for university students working on PHDs
or dissertations. If she struggled for work in the quiet seasons she would
resign herself to spellchecking restaurant menus, signage, and various
low-quality magazines. She had a keen eye for detail though was modest about her
own skills and achievements through life which lended itself well to the shy
character she possessed and perhaps was a gateway to some self-esteem issues she
(and all the Rymers) seemed to carry.
