Judge: "And during this period, you were both left unattended, why?".

Billy: "We were new to the school and I told one of the other kids on the bus to
cover for us.".

Judge: "'Cover for you' in what way?".

Billy: "I asked him to lie. I asked him to tell the teacher that we never came
on the bus. The teacher believed him."

Standing in the courtroom, Billy was nervous. Sweaty palms and on the brink of
collapsing from anxiety. He thought he'd done wrong but the judge was only
trying to clarify how all of this had transpired. 

Judge: "So let me see if what I have so far is correct.".

Judge: "You went with your school on a trip to (TODO) for a week. You told a
classmate to tell your teacher - Ms Williams that you in-fact never made it on
the bus so that you and your brother Marcus could have a trip of your own.
Correct?".

Billy: "Yes, sir."

Judge: "But you were in fact on the bus?".

Billy: "Yes, sir."

A short span of time passed, the judge furrowed his brow and continued.

Judge: "And to you Ms Williams, how did it come to be that you blindly accepted
a child's answer on another child's whereabouts?"

Ms Williams sat on the defendants podium in awe of her own negligence and
shame. She answered none but lowered her head and stared at the floor in the
hopes that proceedings would continue.

The judge sat dormant, presumably thinking and perhaps seething. At one point it
seemed as though he had more to say, until it was obvious he needed more time.
Some moments passed and then seemingly out of nowhere, he spoke up.

Judge: "Mr and Mrs Rymer, It's clear to me that there is a gaping hole in the
accountability of this case. The fact that two, or indeed any number of pupils
can venture off from a group and not have it so much as questioned by a member
of Staff acting in loco parentis is a disgrace.".

Mr and Mrs Rymer sat on the bench showing slight relief that their viewpoint
was understood by the Supreme Courts.

Judge: "In ordinary circumstances a school showing this level of neglect might
be lucky to receive a fine and suspension of the involved staff. However, the
events that followed on from this are far from ordinary and certainly unjust."

Ms Williams shyly glanced at the judge from the corner of her eye apprehensive
about his next words.

TODO - This part needs fleshing out.
Judge: "To the school involved in this tragic story I order a sum of $250000 to
be sent to the Rymers as compensation. Money cannot bring back a life but it can
perhaps aid in reparations for Billy and the Parents. To lose a child
is something no parent should bare witness to, especially over such a trivial
mistake. Ms Williams - You are the crux of the issue and your complete lack of
common sense and care is maddening. Though I see the regret plastered on your
face, it cannot undo what is done. I sentence you to 10 years in the jail (TODO
- what jail?) and order you to never undertake the practice of teaching again."
