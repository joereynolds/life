Billy is an average 13 year old boy. He likes to explore, is constantly covered in more scratches
and marks than a feisty stray cat but is perhaps a bit on the shy side. This
shyness runs deep through the Rymer's make-up, a happy family but one that is
happy with themselves, not needing (or wanting) the accompaniment of others.
They were content as themselves so why have it any different? 

His mother Mary works as a freelance proofreader usually for university students
working on PHDs or dissertations. If she struggled for work in the quiet seasons
she would resign herself to spellchecking restaurant menus, signage, and various
low-quality magazines. She had a keen eye for detail though was modest about her
own skills and achievements through life which lended itself well to the shy
character she possessed and perhaps was a gateway to some self-esteem issues she
(and all the Rymers) seemed to carry.

And of course, there was Marcus.
