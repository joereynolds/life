# Envy

```
I am everything that encompasses evil
I grow larger by the day

I send out vague riddles to make your brain wriggle
and devour you if you come my way

I am not a Sphinx, merely a felonous feline whose 
wretched deeds are trivial yet consume most of your time

I am here to make your life a misery
Pray on every insecurity and character flaw that you possess
until it's impossible to have any form of synergy

I will age you with rage
Make you believe you are free with your mind chained in a cage for not knowing how to
behave

I will take every route possible to activate your insecurities because there's no
better feeling than you being as unsure as me

I will enjoy the time we spend together since you're so malleable and easy to
convince that even the wrong words will make you wince

I will break down any symptoms of fortitude to the point that you're not sure
what to do and every image in your head is warped and the stories misconstrued

I am everything that is wrong with you
I know you better than you know you
You know this to be true because I am you
```

# Woman

```
You are my deity
Etched in wirings of my brain

Your aura acts upon my acts of altruism
redacting any likeliness of a forming schism

You are divinity
Breaking down preconceptions in my mind

Your being conquers preconceived notions
built from the misconceptions of uninformed persons 
wandering aimlessly through an ignorant ocean

You are beauty
A thing that will fade but has sculpted a character stronger than any marble

Emanating elegance, destroying irreverance and binding any wrongdoers to penance

You are a lifegiver
A gift that only half will receive and only a tenth deserve

Bearing the fruit of birth and praying that the seeds you plant realise their
own selfworth

You are you
An individual whose impact should not be confused, misconstrued or told to be
untrue

For as long as there is a believer in your person
there is a believer in you
```

# Rattlesnake

```
I weave between grass lain by other beings
My rattle does not sound, I have evolved

I am a serpent with a venom so subtle it takes years to develop
My poison is tasteless and you can consider my bites to be dull

I've roamed around the ground for years
Sabotaging cattle and feeding my greed for longer than is necessary
```

# Narcissist

```
I am a well bred and well fed man
I've got two legs, a normal sized head and pristine hands

Everywhere I go I put one foot in front of the other
I'm so well put together, I wish I was my lover

Yesterday I was walking down the street and a man reached out with his cup
"Good joke buddy, you're gonna need more than good luck!", I ignored the fact he
was my brother

As I carried on down the road to my silky smooth job where I swear at stupid
people I wondered if I perhaps I was being to mean

Look at me being thoughtful, how could you not love me?
```

# Rooted

```
You brought me down again
You swang sweet lullabies in my ear as I sat and doubted

I was cold to begin with but I began to warm to your suggestions
Maybe I did overreact. I'm better now
```
