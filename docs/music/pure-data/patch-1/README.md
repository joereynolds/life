![My first pure data patch](https://i.imgur.com/0oPXAt8.jpg)

My first pure data "patch". 
It sounds like ass but there's definitely something juicy lurking in the trenches.
2 oscillators (osc~) going off at 2 separate times (metro 1000, metro 120) at random frequencies (random 880, random 2000) and some constant white noise (noise~). 
The output of the oscillators is pumped into a graph for all to see (tabwrite~ output). It'll sound nice next time I PROMISE.
