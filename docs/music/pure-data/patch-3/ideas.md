# Ideas

It'll be a 5/8 drum groove.

Kicks always on the 1,2,3,4 or 5, never on off beats or anything fancy.

Snare whenever it feels like it.

Hi-hats straight on 16ths? Hi-hats are filtered white noise.

Cymbals always on 1,2,3,4 or 5. Cymbals are also white noise but they have a
tail to them.

The main instrument(s) should be a low bass that hits when the kick hits.

The other instrument should be a marimba type sound if we can pull it off.
Listen to 'Cfern' by 'Autechre' for the kind of sound I mean.

## Possibly what it could look like

## Misc

(Not going to do this ideas as it's too involved for now)
Use the data on meteorite landings 
(https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/data) 
to generate some music.

## Rambles

Things I've learn

`metro` can take optional arguments, one of them being `permin` so you don't have to do dodgy math to get a nice human readable tempo, huzzah!
