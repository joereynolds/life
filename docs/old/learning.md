# Learning to learn

## Two thinking modes

You can't be in two modes at once, just like a coin (can either be heads or
tails).

### Focused

### Diffused

Looking at things broadly, you can get to the initial place to understand the
solution but you can't really focus on the details of how to solve the problem
(That's the focused mode).

## Notes

- When you're learning something new, you should be going back and forth between
  both the modes
