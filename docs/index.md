## Projects

A list of various programming ideas that I may or may not pursue at some point.

- biscuits.md - A php feature library   
- franklins-boot.md
- Interactive-apache.md - Learn How to configure and use Apache through the
  command line.  Pretty much like githug but for Apache.
- logical-steps.md
- likelyhood.md - Finds the similarity between two pieces of text. This is
  useful because... We can then pump this into a CSS stylesheet and if they're
  above/below a certain threshold we can warn that they're probably similar
  rules.
- MKLang.md - A programming language based around Mortal Kombat.
- Music command line tool.md - A command line interface for viewing various
  music theory things

  Laravel.
- reaper-package-manager.md - A package manager for vst plugins.
- social-hacks.md - A website aimed at being a central pool where people can
  submit things that *need* to be programmed which would help the
  world...basically. It's like RHOK before RHOK for some reason turned into a
  weekly hackathon
- task-manager.md
- reponere.md - A racket snippet program. Allows you to type a snippet and have
  it replaced.
